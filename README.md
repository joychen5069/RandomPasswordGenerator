# RandomPasswordGenerator

No one wants a super predictable and easy-to-guess password. Everyone has their own reasons to keep their belongings, thoughts, work, and etc. safe! Like all other passwords, this one has requirements! 

Obviously no one likes a simple password. Some people like passwords that are easy to remember. Well, sadly, if you are one of those people, the door is there. Please take it. 

# what it does
Otherwise, my password generator will give you a password that will be ANYWHERE from 8 characters to 128 characters with special characters thrown in. 

I know it sounds like a lot but can you put a length on password security? Anyways, I hope you used this every time you need a new password.
