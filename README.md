# RandomPasswordGenerator

No one wants a super predictable and easy-to-guess password. Everyone has their own reasons to keep their belongings, thoughts, work, and etc. safe! Like all other passwords, this one has requirements! 

Obviously no one likes a simple password. Some people like passwords that are easy to remember. Well, sadly, if you are one of those people, the door is there. Please take it. 

# what it does
Otherwise, my password generator will give you a password that must  

    1. have between 8 and 128 characters
    
    2. contain at least one of the following things
    
        1. lower case letters
        
        2. upper case letters
        
        3. numbers
        
        4. special characters
        
    otherwise, it will not run, and it will tell you to try again. 

I know it sounds like a lot but can you put a length on password security? Anyways, I hope you use this every time you need a new password.
